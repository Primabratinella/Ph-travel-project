            <h2> Why Marikina?</h2>
            <h3>Marikina, the Shoe Capital of the Philippines </h3>
            <p>
                Located along the eastern border of Metro Manila, Marikina is the main gateway of Metro Manila to Rizal and Quezon through the Marikina–Infanta Highway.
                It is bordered on the west by Quezon City, to the south by Pasig and Cainta, to the north by San Mateo, and to the east by Antipolo, the capital of Rizal province.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marikina is known as the "Shoe Capital of the Philippines" owing to its famous shoe industry.
                It is the biggest manufacturer of shoes in the Philippines, producing almost 70% of shoes made in the country.
                Located in the city are the Philippine International Footwear Center and the Shoe Museum, housing the infamous shoe collection of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, wife of the late Filipino president, Ferdinand Marcos.
